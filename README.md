ATM Simulator Project
Overview
The ATM Simulator is a Java-based console application designed to simulate real-world banking operations. 
It leverages core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and 
Polymorphism, alongside Exception Handling and Multithreading for efficient and reliable transaction processing.

Features
->User Authentication

->Cash Withdrawal

->Deposit Money

->Balance Inquiry

->Mini Statement Generation

->Robust Error Handling for smooth user experience

->CLI (Command-Line Interface) for user interactions

Technologies Used

1.Java

2.Java AWT/Swing (for possible future GUI enhancements)

3.OOP Principles

4.Multithreading



Key Concepts Implemented
Encapsulation: Data hiding and secure access to user information.

Inheritance: Code reusability across multiple classes.

Abstraction: Simplification of complex operations for user interaction.

Polymorphism: Dynamic behavior based on object types.

Exception Handling: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and transaction failures.

Multithreading: Efficient handling of concurrent transaction processing.

How to Run
Clone the repository or download the project files.

Compile the Java files:
bash
Copy
Edit
javac ATM_Simulator.java

Run the application:
bash

Future Enhancements
Upgrade to GUI-based version using Java Swing.

Integration with a database (e.g., MySQL) for improved data management.

Additional security layers like OTP verification.
